Welcome to the short introduction to ChocoHax
Updated on: 10/02/2022

1. After downloading the ZIP archive, create a new folder in the `resources` folder, you can name it as you like, DO NOT use numbers or special characters
2. Extract all files to the newly created folder
3. Create a config.json file from the panel where you downloaded the update
4. Move / Copy the config.json file in the ChocoHax folder (where the fxmanifest.lua file is also present)
5. Start the server and ChocoHax

As soon as you have started the server, the config.json file and the permissions.json file will be loaded

If you need to configure ChocoHax, do it using the dedicated panel or by manually editing the config.json file
DO NOT touch the files inside the `internal` folder, it may corrupt the proper functioning of the anticheat

You can use the `lynx` and` lynx help` commands to get more information about the available commands

To set the permissions, consult the updated online guide at the link: https://forum.lynxcollective.ltd/knowledge-base/
