# FAQs

**Q: I bought a similar map from someone! WTF!?**

**A:** You got scammed. 

-------------

**Q: The map goes invisible or I crash near this area, why?**

**A:** Prison maps such as the [Bolingbroke Penitentiary For FiveM](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/prison_map) seem to cause a crash while the player is on foot. 

This is a compatibility issue with the prison map and not this resource.

-------------

**Q: Can I modify this in any way? I want to modify the basement.**

**A:** Not without my permission, no.

-------------

**Q: Can I DM you? I need help with something.**

**A: NO**
