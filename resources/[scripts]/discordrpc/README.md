Discord client RPC by ExcitedCorgi

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 1. go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and click "New Application" in the top right
 2. Give your application a name, this will show up on the top of the RPC tab.
 3. Now upload all of the images in the file named "IMAGES" (KEEP IN MIND DISCORD TAKES A WHILE TO UPLOAD THESE, SO WAIT AFTER UPLOADING.) 
 4. Set up your config below

If you are still having troubles, watch the video in the start of the .zip file.


Want to make more locations?
 1. All icons can be found here: https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/blips/
 2. Save an icon. (YOU WILL NEED TO UPSCALE IT TO 512x512 BECAUSE DISCORD)
 3. Then upload it like you did in step 3 on installation instructions
 4. Go to client.lua and scroll down to line 82 and follow instructions there.
 5. To add more, simply copy and paste the 3 lines
You can do more advanced locations using areaName, but you will need a bit of experience.
If you have vMenu you can go to "settings > developer options > show coordinates" to get your current coordinates

DISCLAMER
  If a player is inside a custom vehicle it may show "NULL". I've tried to fix this but couldn't.
  When I find a fix for this, I will make an updated version.
