Hey there,

thanks for purchasing.

Make sure you do ensure all for of these resources.

If you do have already some of them make sure they are working, these are the base ones except interact sound. Make sure interact sounds are inside the html folder. (baseAlarm.ogg, continualAlarm.ogg)

So ye, make sure config is set up correctly and you should be good to go.
